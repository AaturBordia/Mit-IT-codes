To display data in a table: 

 

Drag and drop DataGridView from toolbox on the form. Right click on dataGridView->add column (number of columns based on your requirement)-> Change the header text (Eg: deptname, name of instructor) as you want it to appear in the form.  

 

            connect(); 

            comm1 = new OracleCommand(); 

            comm1.Connection = conn; 

            comm1.CommandText = "select * from instructor where deptname="+"'ict'";  

            comm1.CommandType = CommandType.Text; 

                       

            OracleDataAdapter da = new OracleDataAdapter(comm1.CommandText, conn); 

      

  // An OracleDataAdapter object represents a data provider object that populates the    DataSet and updates changes in the DataSet to the Oracle database 

 

            DataSet ds = new DataSet();  // This is a collection of DataTables. We use the DataSet type to store many DataTables in a single collection 

            da.Fill(ds, "instructor");   // DataAdapter.Fill (ds) here fetches the data from User and fills in the DataSet ds. 

            

            dataGridView1.DataSource = ds.Tables[0]; // will access data at the 0th position. Similarly you can have one  more query, one more data adaptor object, fill data set with some other relationâ€™s data on which the query has to run ( in which case, ds.table[1] will have that queries result which should be assigned to data grid view)
